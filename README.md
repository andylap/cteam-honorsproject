# C Team Honors Project
Honors Project for ECE 39595 (Object-Oriented Programming using C++ and Java) at Purdue University for Fall 2020.

## Overview
The “C Team” will build a website demonstrating various computer engineering projects. The team will collaborate on thewebsite as a whole, but each member will have an individual page to build. These pages will provide an introduction forbeginners on each topic. Each team member will list his/her contribution below.

List of Topics:
* MacOS/Linux C++ and Java setup
* Using Git
* Tabular vs. non-tabular databases
* Compilers, Bash, Makefiles, and IDEs
* Professional Coding Standards
* Agile/Scrum Methodologies
* Preparing for technical interviews
* Dynamic programming and Big O notation to evaluate complexity
* OOP cheat sheet

## Contributions
* **Ben Loshe:** I will build a page demonstrating the differences between tabular and non-tabular databases, how to use each one, how this topic relates to object-oriented programming and what the trade-offs between each are. I will also help build the css and html for the website.
* **Tim Zhou:** I will build a page demonstrating C++ and git set up for Mac/Linux. On another page, I will go over how to interface essential git commands with GitHub. I will also go over slightly more complex commands that could be useful!
* **Abigail Vincent:** I will add to the page demonstrating C++ and git setup for Windows. Additionally, I will create a page that explains how to develop within the professional workflow of Scrum (and the greater Agile method).
* **Andrew LaPrade:** In addition to helping build the website, I will build a page on how to set up Java for all platforms. Additionally, I will create a ‘career preparation’ page that would provide some guidance on approaching technical interviews for software engineering careers.
* **Brett Weyer:** For my contribution to the project, I will create a page covering Bash commands that code developers may prefer over traditional file system management or IDE code compilation methods. In addition to this, I will cover how these, plus additional commands and syntax, can be formatted into Makefiles that increase the efficiency with which a developer can compile, run, test, and compare code files and/or their outputs.
* **Kaiwen Shen:** I will build a page looking into dynamic programming and big O notation to analyze code complexity. I will introduce the concept and give examples on how to make improvements to the code efficiency.
* **Alia Ahmed:** As well as contributing to the website, I will build a page focusing on different compilers, their installation processes, and unique aspects. Additionally, I will delve into gamification in the Agile method as a separate page or article.
* **Charles Pisciotta:** I will create a page with the primary principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This will include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. This page will include simple code examples to demonstrate each principle.
