		<p>This page covers what you need to know to take your best foot forward when applying for internships and full-time jobs. This includes how to prepare for technical interviews as well as resources to help you prepare.</p>

		<p>Some of the most daunting parts of the job application process is going through technical interviews, especially in a software engineering position. You are at the spotlight to showcase your coding prowess, but you are constantly wondering if you can impress the interviewer and, as a result, get an offer. Here, we will go over what to expect in a technical interview as well as some tips and tricks to help you put your best foot forward.</p>

		<div id="interviews-expect">
			<a href="#interviews-expect"><h3>What to Expect</h3></a>
			<p>First, in a technical interview, you are <b>not expected</b> to get every answer immediately—this is because the interviewer wants to learn how you <b>approach</b> the problem. If an interviewer gives you a problem and you write up the solution code right away, it is difficult for them to understand your thought process and your fit within the company you have applied for. So, being able to describe your problem-solving process will help you more than hurt you.</p>
			<p>The interview usually begins traditionally with behavioral questions, often looking through your resume for the interviewer to get an idea of your experience and fit. Then, the interviewer introduces the programming problem to you, and most of your time will be spent on grappling and coming up with a solution to it. Likely, you will be working together with the interviewer to clarify questions and ensure that your solution is in the realm of what is anticipated. Near the end of the interview will be an opportunity for you to ask questions about the company you are applying for.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="interviews-prepare">
			<a href="#interviews-prepare"><h3>How to Prepare</h3></a>
			<p>The best way to prepare for a technical interview is to <b>practice</b>; not by merely reading a problem and the solution, but by actively trying to solve it yourself. There are several resources available for you to be able to practice (both online and in print).</p>
			<p>In an in-person technical interview, you are expected to write your code on a whiteboard. Writing your solutions on paper as you practice will help you recognize the syntax corrections and code completion you have taken advantage of when you use a computer. It also helps you understand how slow it is to write compared to type up.</p>
			<p>Test your code on paper. Come up with a few test cases and see if they work with the code you wrote up. This may involve going through your code line-by-line to make sure that the test cases work. Then, try to come up with edge cases or error cases to make sure your code is reliable (think of it as trying to hack your own code).</p>
			<p>While you practice, double-check the code you write on paper to your computer <b>exactly how you wrote it</b>. That will help you identify errors you did not notice when you wrote your code and will help you get better with writing code by hand.</p>

			<a href="#interviews-solving"><h3>Solving a Problem</h3></a>
			<p><a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf">This flowchart</a> from Gayle Laakman McDowell’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850"><i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i></a> gives you a very helpful overview of how to solve a programming problem in a technical interview. Summarizing the flowchart:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Listen.</b> Pay close attention to the information that is being given to you. Ask questions and dig deeper into the problem to make sure you can approach it properly. Keep in mind that <b>the interviewer may not give you all the information up front</b>, so it is important to ask questions in this stage.</li>
				<li><b>Provide an example.</b> Make sure it is not too basic for the problem—it is important that your examples help you gather patterns and approaches. Your interviewer may give you some pointers in this step as well.</li>
				<li><b>Come up with a brute force solution.</b> A brute force solution is not optimal and does not cover all test cases. Instead, this is the first step—take the opportunity to identify efficiency issues and cases where the solution does not work. Use this as a steppingstone into improving your solution.</li>
				<li><b>Optimize.</b> With your brute force solution, work on optimizing it. Look for any <b>bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and duplicated work</b> in the process.</li>
				<li><b>Walk through your solution.</b> Once you feel satisfied with your optimization, describe your solution, step-by-step, to your interviewer. Make sure you have a good understanding of the problem before you start coding.</li>
				<li><b>Implement your code.</b> Clean it up and make it beautiful.</li>
				<li><b>Test your code.</b> First go through general test cases, then try edge and error cases. Come up with both large and small test cases to check its efficiency as well as any null variables. Fix those bugs carefully.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Most importantly, <b>do not give up</b>! Keep grappling with the problem, verbally describing your thoughts and approaches. If you get stuck, the interviewer may provide some hints to help put you in the right direction. Know that this is not necessarily a bad thing—remember, the interviewer may not have provided you all the information.</p>
