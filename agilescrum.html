		</div>
		<p>
			I know when I first heard the word "Agile," I conjured mental images of a fancy new software or an unusual coding language. But really, Agile development is a software development process promoted through team management and iterative development. Agile development is centered around the principles of the <a href = "http://Agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html">Agile Manifesto</a>. Agile processes focus on frequent inspection and adaptation. Traditionally, Agile teams are self-organized and have stong principles of of teamwork and mutual accountability. The general business goals of Agile are rapid delivery and development that aligns with customer needs and company goals.

		<div id="Scrum-overview">
			<a href="#Scrum-overview"><h3>What is Scrum?</h3></a>
		</div>
		<p>
			One of the most widely used methodologies of the Agile processes in software development is Scrum. Scrum can be defined as a lightweight framework for Agile development. It is a particular set of practices to be followed. The processes in Scrum are kept small as possible to improve productivity so tasks are easily accomplished. Teams that implement Scrum processes see incrased quality of deliverables, increased flexibility with changes, and generally have better project time management and scheduling.

		<p>
			Now that we know a little about what Scrum and Agile are, it is imprtant to understand some terminology that are used by professionals who implement Agile and Scrum workflows.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div id="sprint">
					<a href="#sprint"><h3>Sprint</h3></a>
					<p>An Agile sprint is a set period of time during which specific work is to be completed. Sprints follow the same general process every iteration</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Sprint Planning:</b> the <a href = "#product-manager">product manager </a>and the development team agreen on the work to be accomplished</li>
						<li><b>Daily <a href = "#standup">standup</a> meetings:</b> to discuss progress and roadblocks</li>
						<li><b>Sprint Review:</b> to demonstrate to the team what has been accomplished in the sprint</li>
						<li><b>Sprint Retro:</b> to look at how the team worked this sprint and see where the could improve next sprint</li>
					</ol>

			</li>
			<li>	
				<div class="mt-3" id="product-manager">
					<a href="#product-manager"><h3>Product Manager/Owner</h3></a>
					<p>They are the keeper of requirements. The PM or PO will be the in-between for the development team and the customers and other product-related individuals.</p>

				<div id="ScrumMaster">
					<a href="#ScrumMaster"><h3>ScrumMaster</h3></a>

			<li>	
				<div id="standup">
					<a href="#standup"><h3>Standup</h3></a>
					<p>This is a daily progress meeting for the development team. Sometimes they are called "daily Scrum". The meetings are intended to be short, but informative.</p>
					<p>Usually each team member answers the following 3 qustions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What did you work on yesterday?</li>
						<li>What are you working on today?</li>
						<li>Do you have any roadblocks?</li>

				<div class="mt-3" id="story">
					<a href="#story"><h3>Story</h3></a>
					<p>A general ovrview of new development for a user-facing feature. These stories are written by team members and added to by the <a href=#product-manager">product owner</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>	
				<div id="defect">
					<a href="#defect"><h3>Defect</h3></a>
					<p>Similar to a bug report in that it describes a failure of the system. Once written, it is entered into the backlog to be assigned for correction in the next sprint planning meeting.</p>

			<h2>Gamification of Agile</h4>
		</a>
		<p>
			Anyone working in or around software development can tell you that Agile is hugely popular in the workplace—you’ll struggle to find a team that doesn’t implement some form of an Agile workflow. While there are many reasons for Agile’s success and widespread adoption, <i>gamification</i> plays a key role.
		</p>
		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			<h4>Definition of <i>gamification</i></h4>
			<p class="mb-0">the process of adding games or gamelike elements to something (such as a task) so as to encourage
				participation</p>
			<p class="blockquote-footer">Merriam Webster</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Defined above, gamification concerns implementing a point and reward system to turn something tedious (as software development can be) into a game. Gamification is an effective strategy because it taps into innate desires for quantifiable competition and improvement, thus increasing participation and improving productivity. Some core strategies include rewarding “players” with points and badges or adding a narrative (story) to make task seem more game-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the workplace, a
			<a href="https://www.talentlms.com/blog/gamification-survey-results/">2019 study</a> on gamification showed that a strong majority of workers felt happier and more productive while using gamification. In an Agile environment, gamification has been connected to positive results due to employees’	achievements being recognized so that they feel valued within their team which contributes to a positive feedback loop (<a href="https://sdtimes.com/Agile/is-gamification-a-motivator-or-a-hindrance-to-Agile-teams/">source</a>). Similarly, gamification aids in creating an emotional connection between people and product outputs resulting in dedicated and high-quality work.
		</p>
		<p>
			A theory for why gamification is so successful when applied to an Agile team—or any team—is the	prevalence of gamers in the	workplace. Applying the same tactics that make video games addicting to software development taps into a language that a typical software developer understands quite well.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, opponents of gamification in an Agile environment have different perspective. CodeStream’s CEO	Peter Pezaris says “I think [gamification]’s a promise that has had good positive results in other aspects of our life and people are trying to shove a round peg into a square hole and it just doesn’t work.” He believes that developers can see	gamification as	being manipulated—and don’t like it. Additionally, software developers are inherently problem solvers and introducing a	game means that it will inevitably become a game to break the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, gamification in an interesting (and tentatively promising) development in the world of Agile development, and its implementation will most definitely evolve in the near future. Theoretically, successful implementation of gamification should augment motivation and productivity—or will developers feel that gamification is too forced and
			manipulative?
