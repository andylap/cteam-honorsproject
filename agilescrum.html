			<h2>Gamification of Agile</h4>
		</a>
		<p>
			Anyone working in or around software development can tell you that Agile is hugely popular in the workplace
			– you’ll struggle to find a
			team that doesn’t implement some form of an Agile workflow. While there are many reasons for Agile’s success
			and widespread adoption,
			<i>gamification</i> plays a key role.
		</p>
		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			<h4>Definition of <i>gamification</i></h4>
			<p class="mb-0">the process of adding games or gamelike elements to something (such as a task) so as to encourage
				participation</p>
			<p class="blockquote-footer">Merriam Webster</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Defined above, gamification concerns implementing a point and reward system to turn something tedious (as
			software development can be)
			into a game. Gamification is an effective strategy because it taps into innate desires for quantifiable
			competition and improvement,
			thus increasing participation and improving productivity. Some core strategies include rewarding “players”
			with points and badges
			or adding a narrative (story) to make task seem more game-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the workplace, a
			<a href="https://www.talentlms.com/blog/gamification-survey-results/">2019 study</a>
			on gamification showed that a strong majority of workers felt happier and more productive while using
			gamification. In an Agile environment, gamification has been connected to positive results due to employees’
			achievements being
			recognized so that they feel valued within their team which contributes to a positive feedback loop (
			<a href="https://sdtimes.com/agile/is-gamification-a-motivator-or-a-hindrance-to-agile-teams/">source</a>
			). Similarly, gamification
			aids in creating an emotional connection between people and product outputs resulting in dedicated and
			high-quality work.
		</p>
		<p>
			A theory for why gamification is so successful when applied to an Agile team – or any team – is the
			prevalence of gamers in the
			workplace. Applying the same tactics that make video games addicting to software development taps into a
			language that a typical
			software developer understands quite well.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, opponents of gamification in an Agile environment have different perspective. CodeStream’s CEO
			Peter Pezaris says
			“I think [gamification]’s a promise that has had good positive results in other aspects of our life and
			people are trying
			to shove a round peg into a square hole and it just doesn’t work.” He believes that developers can see
			gamification as
			being manipulated – and don’t like it. Additionally, software developers are inherently problem solvers and
			introducing a
			game means that it will inevitably become a game to break the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, gamification in an interesting (and tentatively promising) development in the world of Agile
			development, and its
			implementation will most definitely evolve in the near future. Theoretically, successful implementation of
			gamification
			should augment motivation and productivity – or will developers feel that gamification is too forced and
			manipulative?
